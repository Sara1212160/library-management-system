# library-management-system
In a library management system, four librarians are responsible for the daily activities such as creating accounts for the new users.
▪ In order to create an account, a librarian logs into the system using his credentials (username and password). If valid, he enters the new user details. Otherwise, he is requested to re-enter them. 
▪ User details include: ID, name, email, password, account type (Student/Staff/Guest), creation date and set of contact numbers (maximum three). 
▪ Information kept for books include: Title, production year, number of copies, category and edition. ▪ The user can search for a specific book either using its title or production year. 
▪ Only staff members can buy books. When one requests to buy a book, his account type is checked, and if he is allowed to, then the records are checked for availability. If a copy is available, the record is updated.
▪ The system generates reports that show all information of the new users, whose accounts were created within the last 7 days.
